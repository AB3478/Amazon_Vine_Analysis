# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Amazon reviews written by members of the Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. SellBy stakeholders are interested in determining if there is a bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## Results 

Closer examination of the Amazon reviews dataset for toys revealed a small number of paid reviews (1266) with a large majority of unpaid reviews (62028).

The number of paid 5-star reviews (432) was also significantly smaller than the number of unpaid 5-star reviews (29982).

The percentage of 5-star reviews was approximately 34%, while the percentage of unpaid reviews was 48%.

## Summary 

The percentage of paid 5-star reviews is approximately 14% lower than unpaid 5-star reviews, suggesting there is not a positivity bias for the Vine program’s toy reviews. An interesting test would be to see if that is a consistent finding across Amazon’s review datasets. There may not be a bias in toy reviews, but books, lawn and garden, or another category may be a different.
